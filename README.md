Universal Fitness - Production Project


MOSCOW REQUIREMENTS:

Project Expectations: 
 

PHP framework installed - ${\color{blue}-- completed}$
MUST 
< 1 week 
Install PHP framework such as Laravel to ensure ease of development with security features such as login authentication already implemented which allow for development time to be reduced, allowing for more advanced expectations to be met in less time. 


Database - ${\color{blue}-- completed}$
MUST 
2 weeks 
The website will process and store user health data. Unlike name and email, storing values such as height, weight and age will be very sensitive and private for users, so it is essential that this data is held securely. An app that will use many database tables such as workout data, health data and personal data must ensure relationships between tables are as appropriate as possible to ensure with this sensitive data features have appropriate permissions to access different user data. 




Login System - ${\color{blue}-- completed}$
MUST 
< 1 week 
Implement login system allowing users to register to and store their personal data. This expectation will be easily met with the use of a PHP framework such as Laravel – allowing more time coding features which are harder to implement. 


User Interface - ${\color{blue}-- completed}$
MUST 
2-3 Weeks 
Creating an aesthetically pleasing user interface by: 
 
CSS adapted to allow fonts that can be friendly with learning disabilities such as dyslexia 
 
Ensure enough whitespace by spacing out features on the app to ensure features of the app look clearer to users and ensures an overall cleaner layout of the app. 
 
Adaptability to different screens such as mobile screens and tablets. 
 

Secure Web Forms - ${\color{blue}-- completed}$
MUST  
2 weeks 
To ensure features such as workout generator and calorie calculator can be implemented by adding secure web forms to allow for user data to be easily passed to the secured database –allowing for the necessary calculations needed for these features to also be inserted in a visually appealing and organized way. 


UI accessible from different devices - ${\color{blue}-- completed}$
SHOULD  
2 weeks 
Many people now are most likely using websites from mobile devices, tablets etc. rather than computers. By ensuring the app features are accessible from different devices, users will be more likely to use the app and engage with the features if the display is adjusted for different display sizes by changing the CSS of the website. 
 
 
Graphical output of workout data 
SHOULD 
2 weeks 
With features being implemented such as the workout tracker (tracking number of workouts per week) and weight lost for example; This expectation can be met by implementing services such as an Iframe into the app to display this graphical data. This would allow users to see their progress in an easy-to-understand way – quantifying their progress. 


Email Notifications 
COULD  
2 weeks 
Write notification API code, will need to get user permissions to allow website to send notifications to user email. Notifications can improve engagement of the app- ensuring reminders to encourage users to use the app more regularly 



Social Connectivity 
COULD 
3 weeks 
Integrating a social aspect into the app would not only enhance the user experience but would allow users to engage with the features of the app more – sharing this fitness journey not only individually but with friends and family.   


Other language Support 
COULD 
3 weeks 
Potentially could embed plugins to the app that allow the app text to be translated to the user's language. This would be a difficult feature to implement and most likely time-consuming but would make the app accessible for so many more people, increasing the website scope. 



AI Implementation 
WON’T 
N/A 
For future development a feature to implement could be ai workout generation where the ai could scan the internet using the best sources to suggest and create user workout plans. 



Mobile App 
WON’T 
N/A 
With the current knowledge and skillset being used to create the project, the product best suited to be deployed as a web app. With more experience and learning to create mobile applications, the website could potentially be applied to a mobile app interface. 


Connection to phone health data 
WON’T 
N/A 
As an app as listed above, taking in phone health data would be useful for taking user data by connecting for example for iPhone as apple will store health data such as steps per day and users would be able to allow access to this from the app.  


Connection to other health apps 
WON’T 
N/A 
Connecting to other health apps such as my fitness pal (calorie counting app) would allow values such as calories per day and weight logs to be fed to the database but would not be realistic given the timeline to create the product.
